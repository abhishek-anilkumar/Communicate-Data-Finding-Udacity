# Communicate-Data-Findings

# Investigation Overview


In this investigation, I will to look at the bike ride trends and biker type of the bay Area bike share system. The main focus was on biking duration, the time (weekday, hour), and the bike types.

# Dataset Overview


This document explores the Ford GoBike's trip data for public containing bike rides from Feb 2020. The attributes included the trip start/end time, as well as additional measurements such as user type and rental access method.First data should be cleaned to avoid Data inconsistent, or outliner issues.

# Summary of Findings

1.Bike Ride Duration Time: The origianl duration data has right skew issue - bike durations range from less than 1 minute to 1400+ minutes with median at around 9 min and mean at around 12 min. We have to do some data transformation to make data visualization and data interpretation easiler.<br>

2.Regarding the bike ride trends : Maximum booking recorded in february month because of vaction time and We could see that most of the rides booked on Friday followed by Saturday.People love to ride in morning time and avoid to take it in Afternoon because of high Temperature.<br>

3.User type and rental access: Subscriber are dominates compare to customer user and App users are more because of easy functionality.

# Key Insights for Presentation Below are the insights for the presentation:

1.The distribution of biking durations is skewed. After log transformation and outliner removing, we may visualize and interpret data better.<br>

2.Peak biking day and time are shared. Biker types were analyzed.<br>

3.The  rental method for bikers  from user type are shared.<br>
